<h1>Ballin's Struggle</h1>
<p>[10:21:54 PM] Ballin: I had a HORRIBLE night
[10:22:35 PM] Ballin: It starts off with me driving to another city for my might class
[10:23:08 PM] Ballin: The class is d-e-a-t-h. I sat there for 3 hours litening to a boring lecture. I almost lost my sanity.
[10:23:22 PM] Ballin: The class ends.
[10:23:57 PM] Ballin: On my way back to my dorm, I discover that the entrance to the interstate is blocked off.
[10:25:15 PM] Ballin: There was really bad fog this morning, which caused an accident. An 18-wheeler flipped over and has still not been cleared yet. This is why they blocked the entrance to the interstate.
[10:25:40 PM] Ballin: The interstate was the only way I knew how to get back to my dorm.
[10:26:03 PM] Ballin: So I here I am trapped in a random city that I am not familiar with at all.
[10:26:13 PM] Ballin: But I have a GPS. No worries right?
[10:26:28 PM] Ballin: I follow where it tells me to go.
[10:26:32 PM] Ballin: But guess what
[10:26:38 PM] Ballin: The maps are not updated.
[10:26:49 PM] Ballin: It literally took me into the middle of nowhere
[10:27:03 PM] Ballin: And couldn't tell me how to get out
[10:27:18 PM] Ballin: I was in such a rural area. I had no idea where I was
[10:27:55 PM] Ballin: So at this point I'm freaking out
[10:28:15 PM] Ballin: Just a little. I ofc laughed and started thinking about how to get out of this situation
[10:28:56 PM] Ballin: So I just kept driving around, not knowing whether or not I was heading back to the main part of the city or not
[10:29:11 PM] Ballin: The GPS just showed me in the middle of a field
[10:29:43 PM] Ballin: I drive around for a good 20 minutes
[10:30:01 PM] Ballin: Somehow, some way, I see lights and I Kreygasm
[10:30:12 PM] Ballin: I have never been so happy to see lights in my life
[10:30:41 PM] Ballin: So I eventually backtrack to the building where my class was
[10:31:10 PM] Ballin: Now I have to figure out an alternate way to get home
[10:31:49 PM] Ballin: I called one of my friends that was in my night class and asked him how he got home
[10:32:16 PM] Ballin: I eventually ended up on this old highway
[10:32:47 PM] Ballin: Not a lot of lights. All the businesses were abandoned.
[10:33:03 PM] Ballin: So I'm driving along this highway and hoping for the best
[10:33:07 PM] Ballin: When BAM
[10:33:18 PM] Ballin: Something jumps out in front of my car
[10:33:37 PM] Ballin: I was like WTF RuleFive RuleFive RuleFive RuleFive
[10:33:55 PM] Ballin: I didn't have time to slow down
[10:34:22 PM] Ballin: I managed to see what I hit right before I hit it
[10:34:39 PM] Ballin: Of ALL the animals to hit in Southern Louisiana
[10:34:52 PM] Ballin: It had to be a little cute ass bunny rabbit
[10:35:13 PM] Ballin: So after I straight up murdered this bunny I'm like danSad
[10:35:29 PM] Ballin: But I keep going
[10:35:35 PM] Ballin: For about 20 miles
[10:35:52 PM] Ballin: Then after miles of darkness
[10:35:55 PM] Ballin: More light!
[10:36:32 PM] Ballin: Then I see the beautiful blue Interstate direction signs
[10:36:39 PM] Ballin: And I'm like
[10:36:43 PM] Ballin: Kreygasm !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[10:37:23 PM] Ballin: So I get on a different interstate, and my GPS takes me right to my dorm.
[10:37:40 PM] Ballin: And here I am.
[10:37:43 PM] Ballin: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

[10:50:07 PM] Ballin: Oh btw
[10:50:33 PM] Ballin: Yes I tried to pull up maps on my phone, but I had no service
[10:51:03 PM] Ballin: And I also tried calling my dad so that maybe he could tell me where to go or something
[10:51:08 PM] Ballin: But he never picked up
[10:51:15 PM] Ballin: And still hasn't! GingerPower
[10:51:20 PM] Ballin: It's like gee thanks Dad</p>
