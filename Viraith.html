	[9:41:50 AM] Λν Tom: ou can't even drive<br>
	[9:41:50 AM] Ballin: Yeah hitting a doge or a cat is different. I would be pretty upset if that happened<br>

	[9:42:20 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: pllzlzzz tell me that was a typo<br>
	[9:42:23 AM] Ballin: Yeah<br>
	[9:42:26 AM] Λν Tom: that's why you never hit dolphins. they are too intelligent to jump in front of your car<br>
	[9:42:37 AM] Λν Tom: @ rugal<br>

	[9:42:44 AM] ☆BigGreen: in a boat<br>
	[9:42:53 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: lel<br>
	[9:42:59 AM] Ballin: Lol Tom (rofl)<br>
	[9:43:13 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: It's ok, they have other things that makes up for that.<br>
	[9:44:06 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: My dog is giving me a death stare because he knows we're talking about hitting animals with cars. :|<br>
	[9:44:46 AM] Ballin: Does your doge like it when you call him a doge? Mine does. He gets all excited<br>
	[9:44:50 AM] Λν★βιαzεr: I hit a couple of mosquitoes before. (happy)<br>
	[9:44:52 AM] Rugal: he's like, "you wanna go nigga? fite mi"<br>
	[9:45:02 AM] Ballin: Lol Blazer!!<br>
	[9:45:15 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: I have never called him that and I never intend on doing that.<br>
	[9:45:17 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: If I ever do<br>
	[9:45:19 AM] Λν★βιαzεr: Funny stuuuufff<br>
	[9:45:27 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: I hope he kills me, and Ballin comes to my funeral.<br>
	[9:45:30 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: Just to feel like crap<br>
	[9:45:34 AM] Rugal: do you even have a doge, ballin?<br>
	[9:47:17 AM] Ballin: If I say "Hi dog" he looks at me like "What the f*** did you just say to me?" If I say "Hi doge" he gets all excited and starts jumping around<br>
	[9:47:22 AM] Ballin: Yeah<br>
	[9:47:48 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: ...<br>
	[9:48:07 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: If I call my dog he tilts his head like, "Did you say biscuit?"<br>
	[9:48:22 AM] ☆BigGreen: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.<br>
	[9:48:28 AM] ☆BigGreen: - doge<br>
	[9:48:32 AM] Ballin: Viraith you're just like Fearz. He hates when I say doge :D<br>
	[9:48:54 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: The overuse of that damned excuse for a word makes my brain cells die...<br>
	[9:48:59 AM] Ballin: Lol Austin I was thinking about that but I'm on iPhone and I was too lazy to find it<br>
	[9:49:19 AM] Ballin: (rofl)<br>
	[9:49:33 AM] Rugal: what about ( ͡° ͜ʖ﻿ ͡°)?<br>
	[9:49:45 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: Nah... I'm fine with that<br>
	[9:49:48 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: Now that I think of it<br>
	[9:49:54 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: I'm fine with yolo and swag<br>
	[9:49:58 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: Hmm...<br>
	[9:50:02 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: idk why i hate doge<br>
	[9:50:06 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: NO<br>
	[9:50:08 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: I SAID IT<br>
	[9:50:09 AM] *** Λν Vιrαιτh has left ***<br>

	[9:51 AM] Λν Vιrαιτh: I accidently left, I meant to put a space between the slash and leave... but the space bar didn't feel like activating today. :|<br></p>
